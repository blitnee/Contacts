# Contacts App :busts_in_silhouette:

This application allows users to view their contacts directory, search contacts, and add new contacts to the list. The project emphasizes the basics of a React App. This application has been broken down into 4 distinct components:
* `App` - Holds `ListContacts` and `CreateContact`
* `ListContacts` - Displays a list of all contacts and the search field
* `CreateContact` - Displays a form for users to add a new contact
* `ImageInput` - Handles avatar image upload
